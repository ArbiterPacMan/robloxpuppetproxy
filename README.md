# robloxpuppetproxy

ROBLOX's HTTP Service is very limited, and you cannot access the ROBLOX API from inside a ROBLOX game. The only way to get around this is to create a proxy API. This will allow you to do things like get a games info (includes visits, total players, etc.)
All of the code is open sourced, but please credit me if you are going to fork this and modify the code.
You will have to host this using a VPS, or just for free on repl.it with UptimeRobot (note that they may only allow a certain amount of requests).

This allows you to do so much cool stuff. For example, you could make a sign that updates every minute with how many total players are in your game across all servers!
